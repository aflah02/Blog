# Short Memo 1

A. How do concepts of home and belonging intersect with each other?

Home and belonging are intersecting as reflected in Nilkanta’s and Najab’s tales. When
they felt a sense of belonging with Kiran and Fatimah they felt they were at home and
stole/crossed a border to regain/gain that. This shows a sense of belonging implies a
construct of home and vice-a-versa.

B. According to you, how do you see the readings fitting into this theme?

Both the readings fit the theme aptly, Nilkanta, Kiran and the Dog provide each-other a
sense of home and belonging while Najab and Fatimah also provide a sense of belonging
to each other. They went to any extent to preserve this be it stealing, trusting or crossing
the border.

C. Which, among the two readings, did you find more interesting and why?

I found the first reading more interesting because it shows a relationship between an Adult,
a Teenager and a Dog. Miscommunications happen and they remain unresolved bringing
an end to the bond which ripples and breaks the bond between Nilkanta and the Dog
showing how a construct-of-home is shattered.

D. If you were asked to pick one character to justify the theme from your choice of
reading, who would that be and why?

I would pick Nilkanta because he got the taste of a home and a sense of belongingness
with Kiran. He also became a home for the dog, but his actions destroyed both the homes.
His actions to preserve his temporary-home showcase how much value a home brings to
one’s life.
