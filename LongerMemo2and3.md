# Longer Memo 2 and 3

A. Which reading did you prefer more in the Theme “Humour and the Uncanny”? Why?

I prefer Khagam over Engine Trouble as Khagam is a tale which suits more to its theme of
uncanniness as compared to Engine Trouble which was supposedly humorous however I didn’t
find it to be. This is a great example to reflect on how humor as a whole has evolved over time and
how target audience matters a lot maybe a younger audience would have appreciated the humor
more.

Khagam has an eerie vibe to itself. The story a lot of aspects of evil. Be it Dhurjati Babu killing
Balkishen for apparently no reason or Imli Baba having no issues with knowing a man turned into a
snake to exact his revenge, the story is the definition of uncanniness. It makes you feel uneasy
reading the vivid description of Dhurjati Babu turning into a snake while Imli Baba himself always
seemed very shady to me for some inexplainable reason.

B. What has been the most relatable aspect in reading Partition literature?

Partition literature is loaded with heart breaking and nerve-racking incidents which make us
doubt human nature and consciousness. The aspect of communities which stayed together
suddenly becoming enemies in their own homes is the most relatable aspect according to me.
Be it the recent Delhi riots where a peacefully coexisting society burnt to shambles and
neighbors became enemies or other riots which keep happening across the country, we see
hints of partition riots lingering around us. Another fitting aspect includes the satire at play in
Toba Tek Singh, even today the common people suffer while people in power do heinous acts
to stay in power. Also as seen in Raavi Paar, people are highly influenced by the mob around
them and end up doing actions which they may regret for life like the baby was thrown in the
river this is still seen and referred to as mob mentality.
